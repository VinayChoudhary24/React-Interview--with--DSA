#26 - Why we Need a JS FrameWork ?
   -- Readability, Powerfull Functionality with Best Practices are Included, Provides us with Different Environments/Build like DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION. Auto UI Update, Auto List generation, Folder Structure, Easy Testing.

#27 - JS Framework Works in BackGround ?
    -- REAL DOM and VIRTUAL DOM.

#28 - Spread Operator ?
   -- Whenver we Use Spread Operator we Need to Take Care of the Array and Object Type Data Inside i.e we Need to ...COPY the Whole Object and Also ...COPY the Arrays and Objects Inside.  
                                   let person3 = {
                                                   ...person,
                                                   hobbies: [...person.hobbies],
                                                   address: {...person.address},
                                                 }

#29 -- Making COPY in Objects and Arrays ?
     -- For Object we Copy with SPREAD Operator

     -- For Arrays we Copy with SLICE Method
